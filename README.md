# What is my app?
- I created an insurance web app that expands upon what Sanlam currently has in place. It makes use of `session management` and `user authentication` to dynamically change this state of itself depending on the user's authentication and platform. 
- It is built from the customer's perspective where they may:
    1. Register `/register`
    2. Login `/login`
    3. View Sanlam's policies `/pol`
    4. View their own policies `/profile` 
    5. Update their account details `/update_details`  
    6. Get a quote on car insurance `/calculate_quote`
    7. Win rewards from the [Sanlam Reality website](https://www.sanlamreality.co.za/join/?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMInN2C07G1hQMV6URBAh2KLARpEAAYASAAEgJ-0fD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) `/try_again`
        - PLEASE NOTE: This was out of scope of this project and makes use of `javascript`
    8. Logout `/logout`
    9. and delete their account `/delete_account`
